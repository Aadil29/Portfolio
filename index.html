      <h3>Gravity Flip  <br></h3>
            
            
      
      
      <p>
        My first java game development project is about a game I created called gravity flip.During the development, I gained and solidified my knowledge of Object-oriented programming, which  included concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymoirism and Abstraction.  Inheritance was used in my project to reduce  the amount of repeated code,for example, both of my enemies (Aliens and Alien Bosses)in the  game would have the same bullet detection method, which then reduces the amount of unnecessary code required, resulting in a more efficient program.
          <br><br>
          
     

        Also, I learned about the use of abstract classes, which have an overall method but can diverge into different objects with their properties.  This can be seen in my BackpackItems class, as each weapon  will have a operate function, but what/how each weapon will be used is different.
          
        <br><br>
          
          
          

          The game is about Astrount fighting off Aliens and Alien Bosses in space with a Raygun  by its side to eliminate them. The Astronaut also has the help of power-up items, such as Speed up  and extra lives interactable to help get to the next level. The movement mechanics for the Astronaut range  from the basic left and right movements to the ability to flip gravity so he  can  run up on the ceiling and flip back down to the floor as he pleases to dodge and eliminate the Aliens and their superiors.</p>
